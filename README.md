Data and code for the paper BachschmidRomano, Hatsopoulos, Brunel, 2023 - eLife

Data:

Firing_rates.mat contains electrophysiological recordings from the primary motor cortex of a macaque monkey performing a center-out reaching task. Recordings were performed by Doug Rubino in the Hatsopoulos lab, and have been described in https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1802. The file contains trial-averaged firing rate smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with s.d.=25 ms.

EMG.mat contains electromyographic recordings from 13 arm muscles a macaque monkey performing a center-out reaching task. Recordings were performed by Wei Liang in the Hatsopoulos lab, and have been described in https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2212227120.

Code:

The file main.m runs the scripts to analyze the data and generate the plots.
